# Kinematics
The robot joint forward kinematics and inverse kinematics.
## Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics is calculated by vector transform. more DOF is acceptable.
## Inverse Kinematics
The inverse kinematics only limited to 4 types of robot configuration. 
1. Cartesian
2. Cylindrical
3. Spherial
4. Articulated

## Command line Demostration
The code to test the accuracy of kinematics calculation can be found [here](https://github.com/zhuchen115/Kinematics/blob/master/KineDemo/Program.cs)

## Unity Demo 
The unity projects is designed on Unity 2017.3.
Note the axis system used in the unity is left hand axis. The kinematics library is using right hand axis.
